# SBB Butler

The SBB Butler delivers an easy and quick way to get the timetable for your next journey. Just call our phone number and tell us where you want to go. We will tell you when the train leaves at the train station nearby. 

Short after the call you are going to receive a compact SMS with all the stops between you and your destination. We think this is the perfect assistent for people, which are overwhelmed with the detailed information the current SBB timetable provides.

To create this project, we used Cisco Tropo and the Swiss public transport API.This project is meant as submission for the Hack Zurich 2015.
