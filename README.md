The SBB Butler delivers an easy and quick way to get the timetable for your next journey. Just call our phone number and tell us where you want to go. We will tell you when the train leaves at the train station nearby.

Short after the call you are going to receive a compact SMS with all the stops between you and your destination. We think this is the perfect assistent for people, which are overwhelmed with the detailed information the current SBB timetable provides.

To create this project, we used [Cisco Tropo](https://www.tropo.com/) and the [Swiss public transport API](http://transport.opendata.ch/). This project is meant as a submission for the [Hack Zurich 2015 Event](http://www.hackzurich.com/15).

Call Interface for SBB Timetables
---------------------------------

The SBB Butler delivers an easy and quick way to get the timetable for your next journey - even if you don't own a smartphone and are used to the internet. Just call our phone number +41 43 508 07 85 and tell us where you want to go. We will then tell you when the train leaves at the train station nearby.

Accessability Advantages
------------------------

According to SCB over 325'000 visually impared people live in Switzerland while 20'000 people are completely blind. A call interface to the SBB timetable enables these people to stay autonomous and keep their mobility.

Especially for older people it is difficult to use the internet, smartphone or even text messages. While from age 55 less than half own a mobile device capable of connecting to the internet, most own a old school cell phone and are perfectly comfortable making phone calls. Our solution provides a legacy interface to those people. Simple and effective with no entry barriers.
